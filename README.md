# ansible-jenkins

Assignment - TWO

- Create an Ansible automation that deploys inside a Vagrant box the following:
    - Jenkins server
        - It don't need to have user or password
        - it needs to be running at 8085

    - Create a pipeline using jenkinsfile that builds a docker image to run a sample war - (use this: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-
doc/appdev/sample/ )
        - Based in a second repository
        - Running inside of  the Jenkins server implemented before
        - This application doesn't need to run, but the pipeline needs

- Observations for both exercises:
    - Be free to do one of the exercises, HELM or Ansible
    - Try to use the best practices and simple tools
    - Make it in a way that's simple to implement
    - Write a clear README.md for both repositories
    - Share with us in a public GitHub/bitbucket
